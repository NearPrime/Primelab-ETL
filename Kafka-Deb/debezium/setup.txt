RDS Parameter Group Changes

Name                            Value
rds.logical_replication         1
max_wal_senders                 1
max_replication_slots           1

After this change, restart the instance then verify that wal_level = logical (this parameter cannot be changed but should update automatically).
Do this by running SHOW wal_level as postgres user on the database.

We need the following rules setup (won't be needed currently as all outbound is open)
local   replication     dbz_cdc                          trust   
host    replication     dbz_cdc  127.0.0.1/32            trust   
host    replication     dbz_cdc  ::1/128                 trust
